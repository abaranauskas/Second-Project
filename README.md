# Second-Project
Still Learning HTML and CSS 

Second project had pretty much the same scenario as it was n the first one. I was following the tutorial and basictlly just tried to learn all the structure of HTML and CSS and how everything interacts. Of couse I wanted to be as fast as posible so without any knowledges of Javascript programming language I tried to understand those simple tasks of jQuery
